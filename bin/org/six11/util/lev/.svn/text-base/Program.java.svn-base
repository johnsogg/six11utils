/**
 * A Program is a holder for a bunch of modules and views. This is useful when a set of views are
 * generally only used together and you'd like to manipulate them as a group. For instance, Mozilla
 * Classic has a web browser, mailer, HTML editor, address book, and who knows how many other
 * things. Each of these pieces are the logical equivalent of an org.six11.util2.lev.Program. In
 * some respects they seem like full-fledged applications but they are still dependent on an
 * application's resources and model/module/view management.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Program only works if the modules and models it needs have already been registered with the
 * application.
